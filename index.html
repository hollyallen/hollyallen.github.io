<p>I am a engineering leadership consultant and coach. I focus on helping organizations and individuals create and foster successful engineering organizations.</p>
  
<p>Previously I was a Senior Director of Engineering at <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>

<p>Before Slack I was the Director of Engineering at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> where I helped to make US 
  government software better from within. Before that I was the head of software engineering at 
  <a href="https://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>, an open access scientific publisher. Even earlier I was a manager and software 
  engineer at <a href="https://www.dreamworksanimation.com/">PDI/DreamWorks Animation</a>, and a variety of small science 
  and medicine related startups.</p>

<p>I've been developing software since 2000 in both hands-on and leadership roles. I am a pragmatic, transparent, 
  results driven technologist who wants to help get work done. I thrive in team-oriented cultures where we're all 
  working hard for a common goal.</p>

<p>I used to be a mechanical engineer. I attended <a href="https://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> 
  and earned a BS in <a href="https://meche.mit.edu/">Mechanical Engineering</a> there. I still really enjoy making things 
  with my hands.</p>

<p>I live with my family in San Francisco, CA.</p>
