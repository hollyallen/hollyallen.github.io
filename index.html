<h1>Holly Allen</h1>
<p>I've been developing software since 2000 in both technical and leadership roles. 
Before that I was a mechanical engineer, and before that I earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering from MIT. 
I am a pragmatic, transparent, results driven technologist who wants to help get work done. 
I thrive in team-oriented cultures where we're all working hard for a common goal.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>, a non-profit open access scientific publisher.<br>
I attended <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.<br>
I currently live with my husband and two children in San Francisco, CA.</p>
