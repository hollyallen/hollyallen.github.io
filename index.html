<h1>Holly Allen</h1>
<p>I've been developing software since 2000 in both hands-on and leadership roles. I am a pragmatic, transparent, results driven technologist who wants to help get work done. I thrive in team-oriented cultures where we're all working hard for a common goal. I've created <a href="leadership.html">a list of leadership readings</a> for reference.</p>

<p>I currently work at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> as Director of Engineering, helping to make US government software better from within. 
Before that I worked at <a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>,
<a href="http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/">PDI/DreamWorks Animation</a>, 
and a variety of small science and medicine related startups.</p>

<p>Before switching to software I was a mechanical engineer. I attended <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> and earned a BS in <a href="http://meche.mit.edu/">Mechanical Engineering</a> there. I still really enjoy making things with my hands.</p>

<p>I live with my husband and two children in San Francisco, CA.</p>
