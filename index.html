<h1>Holly Allen</h1>
<p>I've been developing software since 2000 in both hands-on and leadership roles. 
Before that I was a mechanical engineer, and earned a BS in <a href="http://meche.mit.edu/">Mechanical Engineering from MIT</a>. 
I am a pragmatic, transparent, results driven technologist who wants to help get work done. 
I thrive in team-oriented cultures where we're all working hard for a common goal.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, helping to make US government software better from within. 
Before that I worked at <a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>,
<a href="http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/">PDI/DreamWorks Animation</a>, 
and a variety of small science and medicine related startups.<br>
I attended <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.<br>
I live with my husband and two children in San Francisco, CA.</p>
