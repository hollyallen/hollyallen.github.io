# Leadership Resources

Here are some writings about leadership, especially leading software engineers, that have resonated for me over the years.

* [Being Awesome](http://katemats.com/being-awesome-at-your-job) by Kate Matsura
* [Leadership](http://katemats.com/leadership/) by Kate Matsura
* [Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com/) blog. I haven't read his books, so I can't recommend them personally, 
but I hear good things.
* [Turn the Ship Around](http://davidmarquet.com/books/) by David Marquet. Okay, I haven't read this book, but 
everything I've heard points to it being great.
