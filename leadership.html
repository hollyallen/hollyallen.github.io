<p>Here are some writings about leadership, especially leading software engineers, that have resonated for me over the years.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://katemats.com/being-awesome-at-your-job">Being Awesome</a> by Kate Matsura
<li> <a href="http://katemats.com/leadership/">Leadership</a> by Kate Matsura
<li> <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands in Repose</a> blog. I haven't read his books, so I can't recommend them personally, but I hear good things.
<li> <a href="http://davidmarquet.com/books/">Turn the Ship Around</a> by David Marquet. Okay, I haven't read this book, but everything I've heard points to it being great.
<li> <a href="http://theenergyproject.com/blog/">The Energy Project</a> is a blog, a newsletter, and the founder Tony Schwartz often writes op eds in the New York Times. Their <a href="http://theenergyproject.com/key-ideas">key ideas</a> about creativity and energy renewal really resonate with me.
<li> Marc Esher has a <a href="https://gist.github.com/marcesher/0553d95a2431fd02e7ba">great list of resources too</a>.
